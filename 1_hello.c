/*gcc - gnu c compiler can be used to compile the program
   ex., "gcc hello.c" will compile the c program
Once you compile the program, "a.out" is created in the same folder and 
   you can execute the program by running "a.out"
The main parts of the program are functions and variables.
Functions will specify the work to be done and variables hold the values that are used in those functions
